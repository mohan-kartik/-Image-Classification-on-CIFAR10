# Image-Classification-on-CIFAR10
Implement a Fully-Connected NN and CNN with Python and Numpy from scratch to perform Image Classification on CIFAR10 dataset.

• Formulated a deep neural network by writing forward and backward propagation from scratch using NumPy without any inbuilt ML or DL libraries achieving final validation accuracy of 62.4%.

• Augmented network using batch-norm and average pooling layers along with weight regularization to classify input sample of 50k images into 10 classes.

• Visualized relationship between validation accuracy and epochs to assess SGD + momentum method’s performance over SGD’s.
